            I'm an international Computer professional.
            I completed the Master of Science of Computer Sciences at UMASS Lowell in spring 2009. 
            Also, I’m a Systems engineer since 1,993.

            I've been developing Relational Database Applications, Web Applications and General Applications or libraries. 
            I can list Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL as some of the RDBMS I've been working with. 
            Also, I can mention ANSI/ISO C, C#, XML, .Net, Javascript, php, DHTML, Cobol/VSAM files, as development languages/tools I have worked with. 
            It's important to mention that during MS CS courses at UMASS Lowell, all projects I had worked with, I used ANSI/ISO C language over a Linux environment. 
            In fact, following any development standard is not a problem at all.

            At UMASS Lowell, I received compliments for some of my projects.
            I could ask to more than one of my professor for recommendation letters. 
            One of them said "don't hesitate to ask me for a recommendation letter, because your project has been the best I've ever evaluated".
            It was a project on an undergraduate Operating system subject.
            So, I just need an opportunity to show up what I’m able to do.
            It doesn’t matter I have not previous experience at all.

            Actually, I have been working as a System's Consultant for a Group of Companies around South America.
            I have done several tasks on their ERP -MS Dynamics GP-.
            My tasks have been detecting and fixing database problems because of previous customizations.
            Also, I have been developing applications for them: web applications (SQL Server/IIIS/.NET/C#/javascript/DHTML),
            winform application (SQL Server/.NET/C#), ANSI/ISO C/win32 API application, and several database views.
            Also, I have been implementing Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 for another company.
            The most important point to mention is that to implement MS Dynamics AX 2012 R3, I have been changing core processes of the company:
            Warehouses tasks, Manufacture tasks, Financial tasks, and also VIN Definition, which is a country rules following ISO.

            Previously, I was working as the System Manager for a Motorcycle assembler company Group.
            I worked for them for about two years. During that time, I made radical changes to the company hardware and software infrastructure.
            I developed an application which works around their ERP Database.
            It led them to break their own assembling, and sales records without any extra work time to achieve their new records.
            My role in the development process was designing, programming, and implementing, all Data Structure, and Stored Procedures.
            The application was developed with C#, and programmers just execute all what I designed and Implemented in the SQL Server Database.
            The main changes were assigning VIN to the motorcycle chassis, registering assembled motorcycle by reading its VIN,
            allocating assembled motorcycle, developing process to send Data to the government office of vehicles registration, an insurance company and a loan company

            Before studying MS of CS in the USA, I worked for CANTV -the main communication company of my country-, for around five (5) years.
            I developed some main applications with Clipper5: warehouse application, purchase application,
            the migration of the purchase application from clipper5/xBase to Oracle/VB, process to move Data from xBase/Mainframe databases to Oracle.
            Also, during my internship at a credit bank, I developed some data collection applications with COBOL and VSAM files.

            I'm really interested in an opportunity.
            I don't have any inconvenient to apply all of my development knowledge in any demanding project.
            My lack of experience with any administrative or development tool is not a problem at all,
            because I can count into my skills, my experiences and abilities to learn new development tools.

            Thanks for your consideration Sincerely,
        </p>
